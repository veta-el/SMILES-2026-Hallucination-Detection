"""
aggregation.py — Token aggregation strategy and feature extraction
               (student-implemented).

Converts per-token, per-layer hidden states from the extraction loop in
``solution.py`` into flat feature vectors for the probe classifier.

Two stages can be customised independently:

  1. ``aggregate`` — select layers and token positions, pool into a vector.
  2. ``extract_geometric_features`` — optional hand-crafted features
     (enabled by setting ``USE_GEOMETRIC = True`` in ``solution.py``).

Both stages are combined by ``aggregation_and_feature_extraction``, the
single entry point called from the notebook.
